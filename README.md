#### By Ian Goodrich

## Description

UhDresBok (patent pending) is a revolution in Forgettable Technology!(C) UhDresBok relieves you of the need to remember all of those pesky details like where your loved ones and important contacts live and how to get a hold of them. But that's just the start! No longer feel like talking to Jim from High School? Just press the "Delete Contact" button and our (any day now it will be) patented ForGetMeNow system completely and permanently removes Jim from your life FOR GOOD! :)
But that's not all. With ForGetMeNowTuuurrbo! you can remove EVERYONE from your life. Are the Feds on to your unpasteurized Velveeta smuggling ring? Are members of SHIELD/Hydra/The X-Files looking to put you in witness protection/a dark hole/an embarrassing reboot? Well grab your bugout bag and press the Delete All Contacts button and BLAMO! everyone on your list is gone like they never existed.
!Forget having to remember contact info!
!Forget individuals!
!Forget everyone!
That THREE LEVELS of FORGETTING for the price of one. Not available by mail, here's how to order...

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Download or clone from Github (repository link below)
* From the console navigate to folder on your system and run "dotnet restore" to install necessary packages to your system. Next run "dotnet run" to launch the app.
* When instructed to, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000
* Now you're ready to ForGetMeNow!

##Known Bugs
* It's still ugly as sin. Not sure if I can't remember (my tiny amount of) css, or if Razor is messing things up. Flexbox failed me so I had to go really simple for now. Probably all my fault, sorry.
